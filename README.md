Measurement of Allan Variance with Zurich Instruments lock-in amplifiers

This file works with any of the ZI lock in amplifier by polling to a particular demodulator node. Currently it is set to the first demodulator where it drives and measures the response from any resonator. In the second section it polls the data from this demodulator node for a certain time which can be fixed by the parameter time_meas. During the poll process the files are dumped in temporary files and are imported again in a single file to perform the measurment of Allan variance. The Allan variance measurements are performed on the phase of the measured data instead the frequency as the later is fixed by the demodulator itself. The frequency can be used in the closed-loop method where the PLL tries to follow the resonator fluctuation. Finally overlapping Allan variance is calculated using Allantools library. The results are finally plotted in a log-log plot.
